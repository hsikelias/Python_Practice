Easy Version
Generate the password in sequence. Letters, then symbols, then numbers. If the user wants

4 letters 2 symbols and 3 numbers then the password might look like this:

fgdx$*924

You can see that all the letters are together. All the symbols are together and all the numbers follow each other as well. Try to solve this problem first.

Hint 1 
Hard Version
When you've completed the easy version, you're ready to tackle the hard version. In the advanced version of this project the final password does not follow a pattern. So the example above might look like this:

x$d24g*f9

And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
